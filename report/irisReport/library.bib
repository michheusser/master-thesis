abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technical competence is the bedrock of surgery, yet it has only recently been viewed as a valid area for either critical evaluation or formal teaching. METHODS: This review examines the teaching of surgical skills. The core is derived from a literature search of the Medline computer database. Results and conclusion: The impetus for surgical change has generally related to the introduction of new technology. Advances initially allowed for open operation within the main body cavities; more recently minimal access surgery has appeared. The latter was introduced in an inappropriate manner, which has led to the evolution of teaching of technical skills away from an apprenticeship-based activity towards more formal skill-based training programmes. There is now a need for a solid theoretical base for the teaching of manual skills that accommodates concepts of surgical competence.},

abstract = {Fetal surgery was born of clinical necessity. Observations by pediatric surgeons and neonatologists of neonates that were born with irreversible organ damage led to the conclusion that one possible approach to prevent this alteration of developmental physiology, was fetal surgical intervention. This led to experimental validation of the pathophysiology of specific fetal defects in animal models and to the development of techniques for their prenatal surgical correction. The demonstration in animal models that the correction of an anatomical defect could reverse the associated pathophysiology led to the first systematic application of fetal surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, in the early 1980s. Since that time, fetal surgery has been applied in only a few centres and has remained relatively limited in scope. Nevertheless, there has been a dramatic improvement in our ability to diagnose, select and safely operate on an expanding number of fetal anomalies. The purpose of this article is to briefly summarize the present status of fetal surgery and to speculate about what may be in store for the future. Inherent in such an effort is a definition of what constitutes fetal surgery. In this discussion I will take considerable latitude with the definition of what constitutes fetal surgery in the future, as it is my belief that technological progress in a number of areas will result in dramatic changes in the practice and perception of fetal surgery.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of death in men. Between 10\%-60\% of patients experience biochemical recurrence associated with treatment failure. No consensus on optimal therapy for advanced prostate cancer exists and even though hormonal therapy and radiotherapy are standards, different groups have included hyperthermia associated with radiotherapy to increase its efficacy. We have tried to analyze these studies to evaluate if this association can ameliorate the therapy in the advanced disease state. From the analysis of these studies, it appears that no amelioration can be obtained adding hyperthermia and the principal cause of this failure appears to be due to the incorrect timing of hyperthermia application and probably the abrogation of androgen receptor expression in androgen-dependent cells},

abstract = {The artificial bacterial flagellum (ABF), a helical swimming microrobot, has the potential to be used for biomedical applications such as cellular and intracellular manipulation. The velocity and the propulsive force of the ABF can be controlled by the input frequency of the rotating magnetic field. In this paper the swimming behavior of the ABF near a solid surface is reported. Three regions have been observed for the frequency-dependent swimming behavior of the ABF, i.e. the step-out, the linear and the drift-dominated region. At low frequencies it has been found that the desired screw-type motion is replaced by a wobbling swimming movement with a frequency-dependent precession angle. Moreover, the experimental results show that the wobbling motion of the ABF enhances the undesired sidewise drift due to wall effects. Additionally, the cause of the precession motion has been investigated by a hydrodynamic model. Our results imply that the linear range of the input magnetic frequency and the output ABF velocity is not only limited by the applicable torque at high frequencies but also by the wobbling of helical swimming at low frequencies.},

abstract = {Colonoscopy has become a routine procedure in many hospitals all over the world for colon cancer diagnosis. This review article discusses the work done by researchers in the quest to automate the colonoscopy procedure. In vitro and in vivo experimentation have been carried out to prove the possibilities of a robot crawling along a patient's colon, treating polyps as they are encountered. Locomotion is an essential part of robotic colonoscopy. The robot must be able to propel itself from the anus right up to the cecum without damaging the colon walls. The challenge is to design a robust locomotion technique that is able to advance through the stretchable, slippery, and mobile colon, which is always in its collapsed stage, in three-dimensional orientation. The authors believe that in the future, conventional colonoscopy will be revolutionized, giving way to robotics to assist doctors in colonoscope manipulation and performing therapeutic procedures and leaving doctors to concentrate on the diagnostic aspect of the procedure, which would encourage mass screening as more patients can be evaluated per session.},

abstract = {In a typical thermoelectric device, a junction is formed from two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (holes) and the other negative charge carriers (electrons). When an electric current is passed in the appropriate direction through the junction, both types of charge carriers move away from the junction and convey heat away, thus cooling the junction. Similarly, a heat source at the junction causes carriers to flow away from the junction, making an electrical generator. Such devices have the advantage of containing no moving parts, but low efficiencies have limited their use to specialty applications, such as cooling laser diodes. The principles of thermoelectric devices are reviewed and strategies for increasing the efficiency of novel materials are explored. Improved materials would not only help to cool advanced electronics but could also provide energy benefits in refrigeration and when using waste heat to generate electrical power.},

A magnetically controlled wireless sensor device is proposed for minimally invasive intraocular oxygen concentration measurements. This device will make it possible to make measurements at locations that are currently too invasive for human intervention by integrating a luminescence optical sensor and a magnetic steering system. The sensor works based on quenching of luminescence in the presence of oxygen. A novel iridium phosphorescent complex is designed and synthesized for this system. A frequency-domain lifetime measurement approach is employed because of the intrinsic nature of the lifetime of luminescence. Experimental results of the oxygen sensor together with magnetic and hydrodynamic characterization of the sensor platform are presented to demonstrate the concept. In order to use this sensor for in vivo intraocular applications, the size of the sensor must be reduced, which will require an improved signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The separation of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is achieved in this study by using a vibrating sample magnetometer and a torque magnetometer performing directional anisotropy measurements in sufficiently high fields to saturate the ferromagnetic phases. The studied material, a migmatite from Minnesota, has a magnetic mineralogy characterized by ferrimagnetic multidomain titanomagnetite, paramagnetic biotite and a diamagnetic quartzo-feldspathic matrix. The low-field AMS represents the sum of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic contributions because the quartz contribution can be neglected, its magnetic susceptibility being two orders of magnitude smaller than that of biotite. In contrast, measurements in a high field isolate the paramagnetic component of the magnetic fabric. The high-field AMS is consistent between specimens and correlates well with measurements done using the torque magnetometer. The magnetic fabrics of the ferromagnetic and of the paramagnetic minerals are not co-axial, i.e. the subfabrics of the biotite and the magnetite are distinct. We propose that this non-coaxiality is due to a vorticity component during regional deformation and that it reflects the general conditions of deep crustal orogenic deformation.},

abstract = {Retinal vein occlusion is an obstruction of blood flow due to clot formation in the retinal vasculature, and is among the most common causes of vision loss. Currently, the most promising therapy involves injection of t-PA directly into small and delicate retinal vessels. This procedure requires surgical skills at the limits of human performance. In this paper, targeted retinal drug delivery with wireless magnetic microrobots is proposed. We focus on four fundamental issues involved in the development of such a system: biocompatible coating of magnetic microrobots, diffusion-based drug delivery, characterization of forces needed to puncture retinal veins, and wireless magnetic force generation. We conclude that targeted drug delivery with magnetic microrobots is feasible from an engineering perspective, and the idea should now be explored for clinical efficacy.},

abstract = {Current procedures for manual extraction of mature muscle tissue in micromechanical structures are time consuming and can damage the living components. To overcome these limitations, we have devised a new system for assembling muscle-powered microdevices based on judicious manipulations of materials phases and interfaces. In this system, individual cells grow and self-assemble into muscle bundles that are integrated with micromechanical structures and can be controllably released to enable free movement. Having realized such an assembly with cardiomyocytes we demonstrate two potential applications: a force transducer able to characterize in situ the mechanical properties of muscle and a self-assembled hybrid (biotic/abiotic) microdevice that moves as a consequence of collective cooperative contraction of muscle bundles. Because the fabrication of silicon microdevices is independent of the subsequent assembly of muscle cells, this system is highly versatile and may lead to the integration of cells and tissues with a variety of other microstructures.},

abstract = {Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bioabsorbable stents has created interest because the need for mechanical support for the healing artery is temporary, and beyond the first few months there are potential disadvantages of a permanent metallic prosthesis. Stents improve immediate outcomes, including profoundly reducing acute vessel occlusion after PCI by scaffolding intimal tissue flaps that have separated from deeper layers and by optimizing vessel caliber. They limit restenosis by preventing negative remodeling.1 The intimal hyperplastic healing response to PCI that contributes to restenosis, especially after bare metal stenting, can be limited by coating stents with antiproliferative medications.2,3 Potential advantages of having the stent disappear from the treated site include reduced or abolished late stent thrombosis, improved lesion imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance, facilitation of repeat treatments (surgical or percutaneous) to the same site, restoration of vasomotion, and freedom from side-branch obstruction by struts and from strut fracture-induced restenosis. Bioabsorbable stents have a potential pediatric role because they allow vessel growth and do not need eventual surgical removal.2 The progression of stenosis seen within stents 7 to 10 years after stenting has been attributed, at least in part, to inflammation around metallic struts, which might argue for an absorbable stent.3 Progression is also observed late after balloon angioplasty.4 Some patients say they prefer an effective temporary implant rather than a permanent prosthesis. Although the concept of bioabsorbable stents has created interest for >20 years, there are challenges in making a stent that has sufficient radial strength for an appropriate duration, that does not have unduly thick struts, that can be a drug delivery vehicle, and where degradation does not generate an unacceptable inflammatory response.5,6 We will review the different bioabsorbable stents that have been studied clinically and discuss the duration of the need for mechanical support and the potential amelioration of late stent thrombosis risk.},

Stone-free rates of patients with calyceal diverticula calculi range from 4 to 58\%, with an increase after longer follow-up periods. According to the importance of residual fragments following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), we have to distinguish between clinical insignificant residual fragments and clinical significant residual fragments. 24 months following ESWL, stone passage occurs as a continuous process, and if there are no clinical symptoms, any endoscopic procedure should be considered as over-treatment. Newer ESWL technology has increased the percentage of clinically insignificant residual fragments. We consider percutaneous nephrolithotripsy in most of the patients with renal calculi smaller than 30 mm in diameter only as second-line therapy.},

abstract = {The irregular vasculature and high interstitial pressure of solid tumors hinder the delivery of cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. As a consequence, the doses of chemotherapy necessary to achieve complete tumor eradication are associated with unacceptably high toxicities. The selective thrombosis of tumor blood vessels has been postulated as an alternative avenue for combating cancer, depriving tumors of nutrients and oxygen and causing an avalanche of tumor cell deaths. The human antibody L19, specific to the EDB domain of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis, is capable of selective in vivo localization around tumor blood vessels and is thus a suitable agent for delivering toxic payloads to the tumor neovasculature. Here we show that a chemical conjugate of the L19 antibody with the photosensitizer bis(triethanolamine)Sn(IV) chlorin e(6), after intravenous injection and irradiation with red light, caused an arrest of tumor growth in mice with subcutaneous tumors. By contrast, a photosensitizer conjugate obtained with an antibody of identical pharmacokinetic properties but irrelevant specificity did not exhibit a significant therapeutic effect. These results confirm that vascular targeting strategies, aimed at the selective occlusion/disruption of tumor blood vessels, have a significant anticancer therapeutic potential and encourage the use of antibody-photosensitizer conjugates for the therapy of superficial tumors and possibly other angiogenesis-related pathologies.},

abstract = {This paper reports the use of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system to propel a ferromagnetic core. The concept was studied for future development of microdevices designed to perform minimally invasive interventions in remote sites accessible through the human cardiovascular system. A mathematical model is described taking into account various parameters such as the size of blood vessels, the velocities and viscous properties of blood, the magnetic properties of the materials, the characteristics of MRI gradient coils, as well as the ratio between the diameter of a spherical core and the diameter of the blood vessels. The concept of magnetic propulsion by MRI is validated experimentally by measuring the flow velocities that magnetized spheres (carbon steel 1010/1020) can withstand inside cylindrical tubes under the different magnetic forces created with a Siemens Magnetom Vision 1.5 T MRI system. The differences between the velocities predicted by the theoretical model and the experiments are approximately 10\%. The results indicate that with the technology available today for gradient coils used in clinical MRI systems, it is possible to generate sufficient gradients to propel a ferromagnetic sphere in the larger sections of the arterial system. In other words, the results show that in the larger blood vessels where the diameter of the microdevices could be as large as a couple a millimeters, the few tens of mT/m of gradients required for displacement against the relatively high blood flow rate is well within the limits of clinical MRI systems. On the other hand, although propulsion of a ferromagnetic core with diameter of approximately 600 microm may be possible with existing clinical MRI systems, gradient amplitudes of several T/m would be required to propel a much smaller ferromagnetic core in small vessels such as capillaries and additional gradient coils would be required to upgrade existing MRI systems for operations at such a scale.},

Here we propose a miniature swimming mechanism that uses MRI's magnetic fields for both propulsion and wireless energy delivery. Our method uses both the static and radio frequency (RF) magnetic field inherently available in MRI to generate propulsion force. The propulsion force is produced by a swimming tail containing waving beam consisting of three coils in a row. Alternating current in the coils acting on the static magnetic field of the MRI will generate waving movement to produce a propulsion force. RF magnetic field will provide power to generate the alternating currents in the coils. We developed a theoretical model to predict sinusoidal waves produced by the waving beam using the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation and multiple- input multiple-output system were solved using antenna design theory. This numerical model predicted that the maximal propulsion from a 10 mm long tail can produce a velocity of 7.9 mm/s force of 5.5 mN when placed in a 3T static magnetic field. A validation study with a single coil demonstrated that the theoretical and numerical model predicts well the proposed swimming mechanism and it is useful for the fabrication of swimming tails.},

abstract = {According to 2010 estimates from The National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders, approximately 17\% (36 million) American adults have reported some degree of hearing loss. Currently, the only clinical treatment available for those with severe-to-profound hearing loss is a cochlear implant, which is designed to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve in the absence of hair cells. Whilst the cochlear implant has been revolutionary in terms of providing hearing to the severe-to-profoundly deaf, there are variations in cochlear implant performance which may be related to the degree of degeneration of auditory neurons following hearing loss. Hence, numerous experimental studies have focused on enhancing the efficacy of cochlear implants by using neurotrophins to preserve the auditory neurons, and more recently, attempting to replace these dying cells with new neurons derived from stem cells. As a result, several groups are now investigating the potential for both embryonic and adult stem cells to replace the degenerating sensory elements in the deaf cochlea. Recent advances in our knowledge of stem cells and the development of induced pluripotency by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006, have opened a new realm of science focused on the use of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for therapeutic purposes. This review will provide a broad overview of the potential benefits and challenges of using iPS cells in combination with a cochlear implant for the treatment of hearing loss, including differentiation of iPS cells into an auditory neural lineage and clinically relevant transplantation approaches.},

Such arrays are implanted into the patient's cortical tissue and record extracellular potentials from nearby neurons, allowing the information encoded by the neuronal discharges to control external devices. While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design. This review presents the biological components and time course of the acute and chronic tissue reaction in brain tissue, analyses the brain tissue response of current electrode systems, and comments on the various material science and bioactive strategies undertaken by electrode designers to enhance electrode performance. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present a detailed numerical study of a microscopic artificial swimmer realized recently by Dreyfus in experiments [Dreyfus, Nature 437, 862 (2005)]. It consists of an elastic filament composed of superparamagnetic particles that are linked together by DNA strands. Attached to a load particle, the resulting swimmer is actuated by an oscillating external magnetic field so that it performs a nonreciprocal motion in order to move forward. We model the superparamagnetic filament by a bead-spring configuration that resists bending like a rigid rod and whose beads experience friction with the surrounding fluid and hydrodynamic interactions with each other. We show that, aside from finite-size effects, its dynamics is governed by the dimensionless sperm number, the magnitude of the magnetic field, and the angular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction. Then we study the mean velocity and the efficiency of the swimmer as a function of these parameters and the size of the load particle. In particular, we clarify that the real velocity of the swimmer is influenced by two main factors, namely the shape of the beating filament (determined by the sperm number and the magnetic-field strength) and the oscillation frequency. Furthermore, the load size influences the performance of the swimmer and has to be chosen as a compromise between the largest swimming velocity and the best efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that the direction of the swimming velocity changes in a symmetry-breaking transition when the angular amplitude of the field's oscillating direction is increased, in agreement with experiments.},

Here, we show that it is possible to synthesize such microrobots to allow them to change size in response to heat while maintaining the same gradient-based propulsion and MRI-based tracking characteristics of the previous versions. These microrobots are made of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) encapsulated in thermo-sensitive hydrogels (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)). This configuration allows them to shrink in response to temperature elevation caused by the embedded MNPs when exposed to an AC magnetic field. In this paper, spherical PNIPA-MNP microrobots were synthesized and propelled using magnetic gradients of 400 mT/m inside a clinical MRI scanner. The same MRI scanner was used for imaging and tracking of the microrobots before the same microrobots were heated by an AC magnetic field of 4 kA/m at 160 kHz, resulting in a 25\% volume reduction of the microrobots. These results suggest the possibility of implementing advanced polymorphic microrobots to accomplish complex tasks in the human body.},

The microcantilever is made of a biocompatible PDMS substrate, using a simple microfabrication technique and a specially designed 3D micromolding aligner. The contractile force of the cardiomyocytes makes a bending displacement of the microcantilever. Conversely, from the displacement, we can estimate the contractile of the cardiomyocytes on the microcantilever.

abstract = {While previous works on cell-based devices for integrated chemical systems have focused on exploiting biochemical functions of cells, we demonstrated the direct utilization of on-board cells as microactuators converting chemical energy into mechanical energy. The concept of bio-microactuators was demonstrated by using cardiomyocytes to drive hydrogel microstructures. Arrays of hydrogel micropillars made by the replica molding method and modified for cell attachment comprised a supporting scaffold for cardiomyocytes. Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were then cultured directly onto the micropillars, attaching to micropillars successfully. Micropillars coupled to cells beat regularly and spontaneously without any biochemical triggers. The beat frequency was about 0.1 Hz at 20 ??C, and the pillar peak displacement beating most strongly in our observation was 6 ??m. The contractile force of the cultured cardiomyocytes was estimated by the displacement of the micropillar. Total natural contractile forces of single or a few cardiomyocytes attached to the pillar were observed to exceed 8 ?? 10-8 N. The demonstrated capabilities should enable fundamental changes in the concept of actuators and cell-hybridized instrumentation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Nature has inspired numerous microrobotic locomotion designs, which are suitable for propulsion generation at low Reynolds numbers. This article reviews the various swimming methods with particular focus on helical propulsion inspired by E. coli bacteria. There are various magnetic actuation methods for biomimetic and non-biomimetic microrobots, such as rotating fields, oscillating fields, or field gradients. They can be categorized into force-driven or torque-driven actuation methods. Both approaches are reviewed and a previous publication has shown that torque-driven actuation scales better to the micro- and nano-scale than force-driven actuation. Finally, the implementation of swarm or multi-agent control is discussed. The use of multiple microrobots may be beneficial for in vivo as well as in vitro applications. Thus, the frequency-dependent behavior of helical microrobots is discussed and preliminary experimental results are presented showing the decoupling of an individual agent within a group of three microrobots.},

@book{Andra2007,
abstract = {The intended purpose of this book, as outlined in the preface, is to enable physicians, scientists and engineers to acquaint themselves with the application of magnetism in medicine in order that the field may be advanced. To this end 'state of the art' articles (covering biomagnetism, cardiomagnetism, neuromagnetism, magnetic stimulation, liver-iron susceptometry, magnetic resonance, magnetopneumography, magnetic hypothermia, magnetic wound treatment and cell separation) have been contributed by several authors which, in the main, address areas of research and possible applications in medicine, apart from magnetic resonance imaging where the diagnostic potential is already established. This book, therefore, is essentially a reference source (comprising some 500 pages of which approximately 70 are devoted to references) and I doubt will find its way onto many individuals' bookshelves, but would be a useful addition to library collections. The source of references is very valuable and the introductions to some of the key areas of development in this interesting field are well described. Since this book is intended for a wide audience, the section on basic physical principles (with regard to magnetism) is quite difficult to follow even though we are urged to skip the detail if we just want to see the results—it is in the detail that Maxwell's equations are best understood. This and other theory sections do not act as primers for the average reader. Mere reference to Stokes' theorem, the Poisson equation, vector potential, etc. without explanation is confusing to the reader. In addition, most of this section is not used in the rest of the book and thus sits oddly amongst the more practically detailed contributions concerning current applications. This is also true of the section concerned with magnetic resonance where some aspects are dealt with in apparent detail, e.g. signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, but would leave the uninformed reader at a loss with regard to an overview of the subject. (Even at the fundamental level, Larmor precession is curiously introduced.) The section introducing k -space is particularly brief and I would guess most readers would look elsewhere for more information. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a particularly rich area for research, and is possibly more important in the context of this book than MRI; however only two pages are devoted to theory and sixteen pages to applications. Other areas, e.g. neuromagnetism, are discussed with up to ten times more material and magnetic stimulation double the amount. Even though the editors attempt to justify the use of a mixture of c.g.s. and SI units, this is not acceptable in a modern text, except perhaps in the excellent first section covering a historical overview. The sections dealing with applications, e.g. cardiomagnetism, neuromagnetism, gastroenterology, etc, form excellent overviews and will be valuable to the specialist and newcomer to the field. Links between the use of common technology and clinical applications are not given in the book (e.g. combining technologies): this could have been included, but the reader is able with hindsight to make the necessary connections. (The Conclusions and Perspectives chapter (four pages) begins to address these important issues.) All the specialists, in their particular areas, have given excellent accounts of the instrumentation challenges and the clinical disorders they are directed towards; in this way the text gives a good overview of some of the key areas where magnetism might be used in medicine both in diagnosis and treatment.

This paper presents a new numerical finite difference scheme for the evaluation of the magnetostatic field based on the fast multipole method (FMM). The interactions between finite difference cells are described in terms of far and near field interactions. The far field computations are conducted using the spherical harmonic expansion of the magnetostatic field while the near field computations are accelerated using fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The performance of the presented FMM scheme is studied by comparing the scheme with a pure FFT scheme. The FMM scheme is more memory efficient and more flexible then the FFT scheme.

Here, we demonstrate that helical nanopropellers can be controllably steered through such a biological gel. The screw-propellers have a filament diameter of about 70 nm and are smaller than previously reported nanopropellers as well as any swimming microorganism. We show that the nanoscrews will move through high-viscosity solutions with comparable velocities to that of larger micropropellers, even though they are so small that Brownian forces suppress their actuation in pure water. When actuated in viscoelastic hyaluronan gels, the nanopropellers appear to have a significant advantage, as they are of the same size range as the gel's mesh size. Whereas larger helices will show very low or negligible propulsion in hyaluronan solutions, the nanoscrews actually display significantly enhanced propulsion velocities that exceed the highest measured speeds in Newtonian fluids. The nanopropellers are not only promising for applications in the extracellular environment but small enough to be taken up by cells.},

abstract = {The intended purpose of this book, as outlined in the preface, is to enable physicians, scientists and engineers to acquaint themselves with the application of magnetism in medicine in order that the field may be advanced. To this end 'state of the art' articles (covering biomagnetism, cardiomagnetism, neuromagnetism, magnetic stimulation, liver-iron susceptometry, magnetic resonance, magnetopneumography, magnetic hypothermia, magnetic wound treatment and cell separation) have been contributed by several authors which, in the main, address areas of research and possible applications in medicine, apart from magnetic resonance imaging where the diagnostic potential is already established. This book, therefore, is essentially a reference source (comprising some 500 pages of which approximately 70 are devoted to references) and I doubt will find its way onto many individuals' bookshelves, but would be a useful addition to library collections. The source of references is very valuable and the introductions to some of the key areas of development in this interesting field are well described. Since this book is intended for a wide audience, the section on basic physical principles (with regard to magnetism) is quite difficult to follow even though we are urged to skip the detail if we just want to see the results—it is in the detail that Maxwell's equations are best understood. This and other theory sections do not act as primers for the average reader. Mere reference to Stokes' theorem, the Poisson equation, vector potential, etc. without explanation is confusing to the reader. In addition, most of this section is not used in the rest of the book and thus sits oddly amongst the more practically detailed contributions concerning current applications. This is also true of the section concerned with magnetic resonance where some aspects are dealt with in apparent detail, e.g. signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, but would leave the uninformed reader at a loss with regard to an overview of the subject. (Even at the fundamental level, Larmor precession is curiously introduced.) The section introducing k -space is particularly brief and I would guess most readers would look elsewhere for more information. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a particularly rich area for research, and is possibly more important in the context of this book than MRI; however only two pages are devoted to theory and sixteen pages to applications. Other areas, e.g. neuromagnetism, are discussed with up to ten times more material and magnetic stimulation double the amount. Even though the editors attempt to justify the use of a mixture of c.g.s. and SI units, this is not acceptable in a modern text, except perhaps in the excellent first section covering a historical overview. The sections dealing with applications, e.g. cardiomagnetism, neuromagnetism, gastroenterology, etc, form excellent overviews and will be valuable to the specialist and newcomer to the field. Links between the use of common technology and clinical applications are not given in the book (e.g. combining technologies): this could have been included, but the reader is able with hindsight to make the necessary connections. (The Conclusions and Perspectives chapter (four pages) begins to address these important issues.) All the specialists, in their particular areas, have given excellent accounts of the instrumentation challenges and the clinical disorders they are directed towards; in this way the text gives a good overview of some of the key areas where magnetism might be used in medicine both in diagnosis and treatment.

abstract = {Following a novel realization of low-Reynolds-number swimming (Dreyfus et al., Nature, vol. 436, 2005, p. 862), in which self-assembled filaments of paramagnetic micron-sized beads are tethered to red blood cells and then induced to swim under crossed uniform and oscillating magnetic fields, the dynamics of magnetoelastic filaments is studied. The filament is modelled as a slender elastica driven by a magnetic body torque. The model is applied to experiments of Goubault et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 91, 2003, art. 260802) to predict the lifetimes of metastable static filament conformations that are known to form under uniform fields. A second experimental swimming scenario, complementary to that of Dreyfus et al. (2005), is described: filaments are capable of swimming even if not tethered to red blood cells. Yet, if both ends of the filament are left free and the material and magnetic parameters are uniform along its length then application of an oscillating transverse field can only generate homogeneous torques, and net translation is prohibited by symmetry. It is shown that fore–aft symmetry is broken when variation of the bending stiffness along the filament is accounted for by including elastic defects, which produces results consistent with the swimming phenomenology. 167},

METHODS: This review examines the teaching of surgical skills. The core is derived from a literature search of the Medline computer database. Results and conclusion: The impetus for surgical change has generally related to the introduction of new technology. Advances initially allowed for open operation within the main body cavities; more recently minimal access surgery has appeared. The latter was introduced in an inappropriate manner, which has led to the evolution of teaching of technical skills away from an apprenticeship-based activity towards more formal skill-based training programmes. There is now a need for a solid theoretical base for the teaching of manual skills that accommodates concepts of surgical competence.},

Drug coatings can be used for diffusion-based delivery, and may provide more efficient therapy than microsystems containing pumps, as diffusion dominates over advection at the microscale.

Nowadays, minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures are often performed with the assistance of robots, such as the Da Vinci master-slave system, the AESOP robot with voice control, etc. In addition, mechatronic technologies are becoming the elective technologies for designing advanced hand-held surgical tools. The introduction of robotic technologies in endoscopy has been slower than in MIS, since the development of miniaturized robotic components for entering the small orifices of the human body is difficult. On the other hand, the large contribution that robotic technologies could bring to endoluminal techniques has been evident since the first development of instrumented catheters. In the 1990s, there was an increasing activity in the application of robotic technologies to improve endoscopic procedures in the gastrointestinal tract. The objective of robotic colonoscopy and gastroscopy was to obtain more effective diagnoses in terms of reduced pain for the patients, and to make uniform the diagnostic procedures, which too often depended on the manual abilities of the endoscopist. Currently, the availability of more reliable robotic technologies for miniaturization of size and integration of functions has allowed to conceive and develop robotic pills for the early screening of the digestive tract, with dramatic potential advantages for patients, endoscopists, and healthcare system.},

Thereafter, we evaluate the different methods of image‐based localization used to identify the position of the probe within the body. Finally, we appraise an emerging technology known as nonlinear magnetic stereotaxis, a technique that permits minimally invasive access to difficult‐to‐approach parts of the brain. We close the review with a few comments on the directions for future work within this field.},

abstract = {Microrobots have the potential to dramatically change many aspects of medicine by navigating through bodily fluids to perform targeted diagnosis and therapy. Researchers have proposed numerous micro-robotic swimming methods, with the vast majority utilizing magnetic fields to wirelessly power and control the microrobot. In this paper, we compare three promising methods of microrobot swimming (using magnetic fields to rotate helical propellers that mimic bacterial flagella, using magnetic fields to oscillate a magnetic head with a rigidly attached elastic tail, and pulling directly with magnetic field gradients) considering practical hardware limitations in the generation of magnetic fields. We find that helical propellers and elastic tails have very comparable performance, and they generally become more desirable than gradient pulling as size decreases and as distance from the magnetic-field-generation source increases. We provide a discussion of why helical propellers are likely the best overall choice for in vivo applications.},

abstract = {Propulsion of chiral magnetic nanomotors powered by a rotating magnetic field is in the focus of the modern biomedical applications. This technology relies on strong interactions of dynamic and magnetic degrees of freedom of the system. Here we study in detail various experimentally observed regimes of the helical nanomotor orientation and propulsion depending on the actuation frequency, and establish the relation of these two properties to the remanent magnetization and geometry of the helical nanomotors. The theoretical predictions for the transition between the regimes and nanomotor orientation and propulsion speed are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. The proposed theory offers a few simple guidelines towards the optimal design of the magnetic nanomotors.},

The experimentally observed dynamics could be understood from analytical solutions of the Stokes equation, with explicit formulae derived for the dynamical states as a function of the object dimensions and the parameters defining the external torque. Under certain conditions, multiple analytical solutions to the Stokes equations exist, which have been investigated through numerical analysis of their stability against small perturbations and their sensitivity towards initial conditions. These experimental results and analytical formulae are general enough to be applicable to the rotational motion of any isolated elongated object at low Reynolds numbers, and could be useful in the design of non-spherical nanostructures for diverse applications pertaining to microfluidics and nanoscale propulsion technologies.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data for this study were obtained via a retrospective analysis of records at the Ear Medical Group, San Antonio, TX, after IRB approval at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The surgical complications of MICI were recorded in a spreadsheet format; 176 patients were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 22 (12.5\%) complications were noted in the study. There were 0 life-threatening, 7 major, and 15 minor complications. Of the 7 major complications, 3 were device failures, 2 developed delayed mastoiditis, 1 required receiver/stimulator repositioning, and 1 involved facial paralysis. CONCLUSIONS: MICI is as safe as standard cochlear implantation (SCI) and affords with it other benefits. Eliminating the scalp flap avoids devascularization and minimizes the opportunity of flap infection or necrosis. Complications not related to the flap are similar to SCI. EBM rating: C-4.},

abstract = {Stents are devices implanted into vessels or ducts in the body to remove a constriction by holding the vessel or duct open. Deployment of stents is a major challenge; deployment is often performed by expanding a balloon onto which the stent has been crimped or by releasing a self-expanding stent or a coiled stent from a restraining sheath. The expanding stent pushes the inner lumen radially outward to restore patency. Several biomechanical issues pertaining to stents exist, such as they should not overstress the vessel wall on expansion nor should they straighten a curved vessel, as that would generate high stresses at the ends of the stent. Restenosis (reformation of the original blockage) was always an issue with “bare metal stents” but this problem has, it seems, been largely overcome by coating the stents with an anti-proliferative drug. A comprehensive description of the main cardiovascular stent designs is given and the main issues facing innovation in stent design in the future are outlined.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel swimming method mediated by traveling waves in elastic tails. The propulsion method is potentially appropriate for maneuvering microrobots inside the human body. The swimming action relies on the creation of a traveling wave along a piezoelectric layered beam divided into several segments. This requires that a voltage with the same frequency, but different phases and amplitudes, be applied to each segment. The swimming pattern was analyzed theoretically by solving the coupled electric-elastic-fluidic problem, and was optimized to attain reasonable thrust. It was found that despite extreme size limitations, a tail manufactured by current microelectromechanical-devices technology, using piezoelectric material, is able to swim in water at a speed of several centimeters per second. The swimming theory was verified experimentally using an upscaled model that produced propulsion of 0.04 mN, which matches closely the theoretically predicted propulsion},

abstract = {Magnetic-nanoparticle-mediated intracellular hyperthermia has the potential to achieve localized tumor heating without any side effects. The technique consists of targeting magnetic nanoparticles to tumor tissue followed by application of an external alternating magnetic field that induces heat through N\'{e}el relaxation loss of the magnetic nanoparticles. The temperature in tumor tissue is increased to above 43°C, which causes necrosis of cancer cells, but does not damage surrounding normal tissue. Among magnetic nanoparticles available, magnetite has been extensively studied. Recent years have seen remarkable advances in magnetite-nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia; both functional magnetite nanoparticles and alternating-magnetic-field generators have been developed. In addition to the expected tumor cell death, hyperthermia treatment has also induced unexpected biological responses, such as tumor-specific immune responses as a result of heat-shock protein expression. These results suggest that hyperthermia is able to kill not only local tumors exposed to heat treatment, but also tumors at distant sites, including metastatic cancer cells. Currently, several research centers have begun clinical trials with promising results, suggesting that the time may have come for clinical applications. This review describes recent advances in magnetite nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia.},

abstract = {The swimming of a bacterium or a biomimetic nanobot driven by a rotating helical flagellum is often interpreted using the resistive force theory developed by Gray and Hancock and by Lighthill, but this theory has not been tested for a range of physically relevant parameters. We test resistive force theory in experiments on macroscopic swimmers in a fluid that is highly viscous so the Reynolds number is small compared to unity, just as for swimming microorganisms. The measurements are made for the range of helical wavelengths $\lambda$, radii R, and lengths L relevant to bacterial flagella. The experiments determine thrust, torque, and drag, thus providing a complete description of swimming driven by a rotating helix at low Reynolds number. Complementary numerical simulations are conducted using the resistive force theories, the slender body theories of Lighthill and Johnson, and the regularized Stokeslet method. The experimental results differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the predictions of resistive force theory. The difference is especially large for and/or , parameter ranges common for bacteria. In contrast, the predictions of Stokeslet and slender body analyses agree with the laboratory measurements within the experimental uncertainty (a few percent) for all $\lambda$, R, and L. We present code implementing the slender body, regularized Stokeslet, and resistive force theories; thus readers can readily compute force, torque, and drag for any bacterium or nanobot driven by a rotating helical flagellum.},

@article{Gupta1999,
abstract = {Purpose: Vitreoretinal surgery involves the manipulation of delicate retinal membranes with a required surgical accuracy often on the order of tens of microns, a scale at or near the limit of human positional ability. In addition, forces imposed by the tissue on the surgical cool are exceedingly small. Here we investigate the magnitude of forces generated during retinal surgery in cadaveric porcine eyes and compare the results with the magnitude of forces discernable by retinal surgeons. This data will be used as a design guideline for robotic surgical augmentation systems currently under development Methods: The study was performed in two phases. First, retinal surgeons manipulated the retina of porcine cadaver eyes with a calibrated 1-axis force sensing retinal pick while data was simultaneously recorded. In the second phase, blindfolded subjects held the pick and were instructed to press a button whenever an “event” was felt. Events were generated by slowly tapping the end of the pick with varying force while both the magnitudes of forces applied and the responses of the subjects we recorded. The magnitudes of forces generated during retinal surgery were then compared with those that could be discerned by the subjects. Results: Roughly 75\% of all forces measured during retinal microsurgery were found to be less than 7.5 mN in magnitude, however only 19.3 ± 8.1\% (N=492) of events generated at this level could be felt by the subjects. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that a majority of retinal surgery is probably performed without the surgeon being able to “feel” interactions between retinal tissue and the surgical tool. Prior studies have indicated that relying on visual feedback alone increases the length of manual manipulation tasks and reduces task accuracy. The lack of tactile sensation during retinal surgery similarly could adversely affect surgical outcome.},
