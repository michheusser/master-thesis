\section*{Preface}

First of all I would like to thank Naveen for his experienced advice who always managed to question the theories and for the very deep and interesting philosophic talks that not only managed to make me see things from a complete different angle but also kept me always motivated throughout my work.\\

Secondly I would like to thank Andrew for his very strong mathematical and computational skills that always made me push the boundaries and kept me well challenged. It seems that every time I felt there was no solution to a problem, he came with a life-changing answer, that made things look easy again.\\

 Finally I would like to thank the members of the department, specially George and my fellow students doing their thesis, for making my stay at the department a very rewarding and pleasant experience. I'm happy, not only to have learned a lot on my subject during this period, but also to have made good friends during it.
